# Two-body cuts

[![Latest release][releases-badge]][github releases]

Code that implements a variety of cuts for selecting two-body kinematics
at hadron colliders, including those from arXiv:2006.nnnnn.

Various examples are provided:

- example1.cc: simple usage given kinematics for each of two decay
  products

- example2.cc: illustrates a Monte Carlo calculation of the acceptance
  for given Higgs kinematics, including the full setup of the CBI_HR
  cuts (with an additional raised threshold at high rapidities).
