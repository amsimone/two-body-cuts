# Two-body cuts

Code that implements a variety of cuts for selecting two-body kinematics
at hadron colliders, including those from arXiv:2006.nnnnn.

Various examples are provided:

- [example1.cc](blob/main/example1.cc): simple usage given kinematics for each of two decay
  products

- [example2.cc](blob/main/example2.cc): illustrates a Monte Carlo calculation of the acceptance
  for given Higgs kinematics, including the full setup of the CBI_HR
  cuts (with an additional raised threshold at high rapidities).
